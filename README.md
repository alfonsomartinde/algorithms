# Algorithms
Some algorithms I've had to deal with, in some interview process.

## Some examples
> "Given an array of strings, return the first one which appears only once in the array."

> "Given a string, how do we check if any anagram of it can be a palindrome? For example let us consider the string 'AAC'. An anagram of it is 'ACA' which is a palindrome. We have to write a method which takes a string and outputs true if we can form a palindrome from any anagram of the given string. Otherwise outputs false."

> "Write a function that, given a sequence, returns its equilibrium index (any) or -1 if no equilibrium index exists. Assume that the sequence may be very long."
