# Algorithms

Some algorithms I've had to deal with, in some interview process.

## Some examples

> "Write a function that, given a sequence, returns its equilibrium index (any) or -1 if no equilibrium index exists. Assume that the sequence may be very long."

> "Given a one-directional list of movie titles in order of how long ago you watched them (there may be duplicates), find the least-recently watched singleton movie title."

> "Given a binary tree, design an algorithm that does a level order traversal of the tree, where each level is printed out in the reverse order as the previous level."

> "you're a guard of a prison, you want to keep an eye on the most dangerous prisoner. Each prisoner has a danger rank of his own and a group of friends (who also have danger ranks). You'll need to go through the prison and find out the prisoner who has the highest danger rank (his own + all his friends)"

### Solved algorithms:

* **001**: [Anagram that can be a palindrome - Solution](app/js/algorithms/001.js) 
> "Given a string, how do we check if any anagram of it can be a palindrome? For example let us consider the string 'AAC'. An anagram of it is 'ACA' which is a palindrome. We have to write a method which takes a string and outputs true if we can form a palindrome from any anagram of the given string. Otherwise outputs false."

* **002**: [First unique string in array - Solution](app/js/algorithms/002.js) 
> "Given an array of strings, return the first one which appears only once in the array."

* **003**: [Reverse words in place](app/js/algorithms/003.js) 
> "If you have a string like 'I am the good boy'. How can you generate 'I ma eht doog yob'? Please note that the words are in place but reverse."

* **004**: [Finding the Equilibrium Index](app/js/algorithms/004.js) 
> "Given an array of numbers arr, find the first index at which the sums before and after that index are equal. If there're no equilibrium index, then return -1. For example: given [9,12,3,4,6,1,3,7], the first equilibrium index is 2, because the sum of left side [9,12], is the same that the sum of the right part [4,6,1,3,7]: 9 + 12 === 4 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 7"
